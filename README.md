# Repeater

Repeater is a JavaScript module designed to [replace](http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful) JavaScript's native setInterval and setTimeout functions.

It works like setInterval, but also allows you to set a maximum number of repeats. Try the demo! You can set a function to repeat as many times as you like.
