# Repeater

Repeater is a JavaScript module that repeats any function at a regular interval. Repeater is designed to [replace](http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful) JavaScript's native setInterval function.

Try the demo! You can start, pause, resume, and reset the repeater at any time.
